Naive Bayes Classifer for polarity in movie review  dataset

Overview
********

This is a file explaining how to execute the Sentiment_Analysis_Naive_Bayes.R code in RStudio with the data set file poarity_review with 1000 positive reviews and 1000 negative reviews. 


Files:
Sentiment_Analysis_Naive_Bayes.R

Dataset Files:

There is one top-level directory [txt_sentoken/] 
and it contains [pos/, neg/]corresponding to the training and test sets. 

Procedure:

DATA PROCESSING
1.	Import necessary packages, set directory and load the text files unto the R environment using readtext() function.
2.	Create class label type for positive and negative reviews, combine the data into one data frame and randomize the columns.
3.	Consolidate the text files into single corpus.
4.	Perform data cleaning techniques to make the corpus useful for sentiment analysis.
a.	Convert to lowercase.
b.	Remove numbers.
c.	Remove Stopwords.
d.	Remove punctuations.
e.	Convert words to root form (stemming).
f.	Strip white space.
5.	Transform the data to DocumentTermMatrix form.
TRAINING THE MODEL
6.	Split and create training (75% - 1500 reviews) and testing data (25% - 500 reviews).
7.	Create labels for positive and negative reviews for validation.
8.	Perform frequent word search and indicate the features for training the model.
9.	Build the Na√Øve Bayes Classifier model for the training data.
EVALUATION
10.	Use the classifier model to predict the polarity in the testing data and obtain CrossTable.
PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT
11.	Change the Stopwords to include more words along with the default set.
12.	Change the frequency of the indicator features for better training.
13.	Apply the Laplace estimator and compare the results before and after Laplace smoothing.
